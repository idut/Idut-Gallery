Idut Gallery is a powerful yet user friendly website photo gallery system. It can be easily customised and incorporated into an existing website. Written in PHP, you can upload images to your gallery using FTP or the built-in upload system. As well as looking great, you can add descriptions to your albums and images and users can comment on your photos! Idut Gallery is simple to install and doesn't require a database.<br>
